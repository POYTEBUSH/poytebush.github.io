<h2 class='greenunder'>Introduction</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence in computer games is used to enhance the gameplay through increasing the population and interaction it offers to the players.
This study aims to look at the approaches taken to improve Artificial intelligent (AI) human based agents such as troops in a military simulator or NPC’s in MMORPG’s. 
The aforementioned AI agents must follow human-like actions and approaches to issues to make them appear less robotic and pre-calculated.

One major issue with AI Agents is that due to the complexity of their actions they are often pre-programmed to perform actions in the best possible way,
this however to the human eye may not seem the smartest of options.
An example of this is in path-finding where the AI agent will choose
to take the shortest route without any application to forward which in comparison
a human might opt to cut corners or take a longer route which in hindsight might be safer.
The aim of my research is to analyse and compare different approaches made in the games industry
to improve the appearance of AI agents with the aim to make them appear more like human controlled characters and less out of place

My aim for this study is to analyse multiple techniques in order to create an AI system to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AssaultCube">Assaulty Cube</a> which is a Free Open Source FPS game
built on the <a href="http://cubeengine.com/cube.php4">CUBE Engine</a>.

This study is currently on-going and will be completed along side documentation and a thesis report.
