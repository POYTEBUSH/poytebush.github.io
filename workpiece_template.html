<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In 2017-2018 I was working at a company called Rake Mark who is based in Stafford for my placement. The company specialises in Web development and database scripting and has multiple clients which they provide a service to. The main project that Rake Mark have and that I was able to work on was a suite of management software and websites called e-Quip used by multiple NHS departments around the country. The main piece of software is a desktop suite which allows the different departments to log calls, monitor and search for assets along with training new staff and audits (There are many more features but these are the ones I relate to). The software is installed on site and hosted on a T-SQL server. Rake Mark being a web development company were then hired to create a series of microsites with each performing one of the aforementioned tasks with the added bonus of it not needing to be installed on each computer. There are 4 microsites that I worked on whilst at Rake Mark: Job Logging, Ward Users, Simple Training and MTS (External extra project).

<h4>Microsites</h4>
<p>
 I started off working on the Ward Users Microsite. This site acts as a Library for the nurses and doctors on a ward and allows them to search for an asset or job in a table, they are then able to click on a row and be shown in-depth details on the chosen item. I started off with little knowledge of HTML, Javascript and T-SQL and quickly learn my way around the app whilst being tasked with fixing basic bugs around it. I moved towards the customisabilty of the page which is done through the user updating an XML field which states what the data is and how to show it. The main difficulty with the added customisabilty of the site meant that when a user changed a field and clicked save we needed to ensure that all fields were saved to the database and were saved correctly using the specified data types. This was my first experience of using T-SQL with only a base use of MySql beforehand, quickly teaching me the different features of a Database including Tables, views and procs and how to use a profiling trace to view data transfers to work out where a bug occurs or why a table isn’t being updated. Originally the site only used basic HTML controls with each piece of data either sitting in a textbox or an outdated dropdown. I was tasked with finding solutions to displaying the plethora of different data e-Quip contains using newer dropdowns, and being able to build custom controls with javascript for currency fields with Net, gross and VAT and eventually moving on to creating a new server-side table view in which the user can specify the columns they wish to see and the dataset to display (with nothing pre-coded) allowing them to search through the data using pagination, custom filters, sorts and more with only the amount of rows displayed ever being brought back (If the page shows 10 rows we get 10 rather than the 30,000+ it could be). This task required me to perform my own tests and research on the solution and script up the table to ensure it is working as expected without much guidance only a specification and enabled me to learn Javascript and learn from my mistakes in code to build up a solution that also performed quickly due to a large amount of data the page might contain.

<h4>Ward Users</h4>&nbsp;<a href='https://warduser.e-quip.uk.net' target='_blank'>Link</a>
<p>
    Whilst working on Ward Users I was also given the task of building up a new Job Logging site from scratch to mimic and improve on one created around 8 years beforehand. Similar to the other sites this uses ASP.Net and allowed me to gain a hands-on approach to setting up the site and how it’s file structure works. This site is more simplified than Ward Users allowing the user to select an asset and log a Job for it. I was tasked at first with simply rebuilding the site with a newer fresh look using Bootstrap 3 controls. Once completed I discussed with the project lead different ideas I had on improving the site and set to work on changing the drop down used to select the asset to be a table similar to the ones used in Ward Users that could display more data, along with making the fields the user filled in on the form also customisable via an XML which was a feature that was not used before. We used a lot of XML fields where possible due to each NHS department working differently, allowing them to only show the data they wish to be filled out. To improve on the speed of the site when logging a Job we moved away from using a PostBack when sending data to using API Post and JSON objects into a webmethod. This allowed the page to send the data and log the Job without the page refreshing, giving me a new insight into how an ASP.Net webpage’s life cycle works. We also included into the site a feature to allow an email to be sent when a Job is logged to the sender and technicians where required. Emailing requires a lot of information to be stored which we originally stored in the sites web config. We decided that we wanted the admins/managers to be able to log in somewhere securely and edit different parts of the site including the email settings without needing to access the web server. We both agreed on the idea of having an admin panel which would only be accessible by people with a set of permissions. I quickly went about building up a Login page utilising the existing security code for login in, researching how best to keep a password secure, and storing/creating a new session object storing relevant information about the user. The admin panel features a large number of settings that the admins/managers might wish to change so we needed a place to save them, we decided on using a Database table and using a proc to update where required. This was the first Table and proc I self-coded and taught myself how to use Linq, Entity framework and SQL Parameters to make the code more readable and secure. One extra part we added to the Admin section of the site was a Table with a list of Locations; in e-Quip there are a list of Locations that an asset might be located which are all set and managed by a user, There is also a Site field which might be a hospital with the locations being a ward. Due to a trust potentially having multiple Sites we built up this table to allow the admin/manager to tick all of the Locations and sites that they want the users to be able to see for their site, hiding all of the others allowing me to learn more in-depth Linq to filter incoming data and SQL select statements. 
Simple training was an improvement of an existing site training site with the requirements to make it more simplified to use. The idea of the training site is for a manager to be able to put their Nurses in a Competency group (How well they perform using a specific piece of equipment). Similar to Job Logging we decided that an Admin panel would be a good improvement to the site (Currently the manager did all of their work via the Desktop app). Using more Javascript, C# ASP and TSQL I created the new section of the Web App to allow the manager to set up competence groups and the equipment they contain followed by the nurses that used them, I then moved on to adding a section of the site where the manager could view the competency levels of a nurse or a group and then have the option to approve the specified competency level (Nurse says they are competent, manager agrees or disagrees). This section also included the Option to Excel Export tables to either a Crosstab or matrix report which I had to make sure was fully working with the new data and update where required. This site was my first major site where I was able to make a lot of suggestions on the functionality, Getting set a brief and being able to create the page or asset to fit the requirements without too much input from anyone else.

<p>The training microsite along with the MTS project were the first two sites that I was able to work with the customer directly through secondary communication receiving their feedback and applying it where needed rather than working to just the specification of the company.
MTS is a company within the NHS who service equipment for a number of different hospitals around central-south London. I was given the opportunity to work on a redesign for their dated website giving me the first project where I worked solo on a website fully for an external company. The site utilises e-Quip databases at a backend except the company uses the system to manage all the different hospitals' assets and jobs with each hospital having their own logins that they can use to view their specific ones. Starting with looking at the original design I set out redesigning the website to follow the same layout with newer controls and improved use of javascript (reducing the need of postbacks), this allowed me to self teach myself the use of CSS code to keep the design of the webpage consistent and easily customisable. Starting off with the basics I moved all of the original content over from the old site e.g. articles and downloads. Once the original items were moved i started to work on the tables / grid that the customers of the site would use to see their info, similar to Ward Users this site allows people to have a simplified (MTS specified) set of columns individual to each user, when the user clicks on the Asset or Job code for the specific item (hyperlinked table cell) they are shown a page with more in-depth details. Another requirement of this view was to add a printer friendly page that would act as a receipt this was something new me and needed base HTML code to keep everything on the page clean, The print-friendly view also contained the MTS company logo and the which the company needed the ability to update at any time with ease. For this, we created a login section, if you are one of the customers with an active account you will see your tables and data, if you log in with the admin information then you are taken to the admin section of the site where you can manage all aspects of the site. The admin site allows MTS to easily create new and edit existing accounts without the need to delve into their database, each customer has custom table columns for Jobs and Assets along with custom fields that they see in the details pages. To set up custom layouts for each customer I designed a modernised table which all available columns they could use are listed, the admin simply needs to tick the rows for all the fields or columns that they want the user to see along with the option to set a custom header/field name for each. In e-Quip there are also a lot of different ways to filter the large amounts of data you have including a “look for/look in” system and custom filters and sorts. Sorting already came with the table that we used for the customers (Infragistics Web Data Grid, although it’s dated it is used in Ward Users and existing code existed) and “look for look in” exists inward users meaning that it only needed to be moved over with the addition of having the MTS admins set which filters each customer can use. A “look for look in” filter works similar to an SQL statement where you say exactly what you want to look for and where using SQL Wildcard expressions, e.g. I want to find a “McKinley T34” asset so I might look for it by “McKinley” as a Brand or “T34” as a model, when the filter is applied is posts back the table applying all of the custom filters in the backend whilst keeping the users sort, page and restrictions. We also added Custom filters which are selectable via a modal, this is not something that is used in any of the other microsites currently and needed to be added into the tables filter code, when one type of filter is added the other one gets removed however the sort and pages must stay (Only bring back the data you can see, page is reset when a new filter is made just kept when changing). Once the filters were complete I set off completing the site which included adding the page for setting the company address and uploading their logo along with some additional small changes where required.

<h4>Mobile Development</h4>
<p>My final project and the only one that is ongoing is a mobile app project for a Field service managing app which at first would work with e-Quip. Whilst I had worked on mobile development in my Games course at University this was my first hands-on experience working on a professional application. The aim of the application is to allow technicians that use e-Quip to be able to go around the hospital (or wherever their jobs are) fixing all of the assets and completing their jobs, rather than them having to then come back and type up all of their work at the end we wanted to give them the option to do all the work remotely there and then whilst utilising the features of a mobile phone to also reduce costs that an EBME department might have such as cameras and barcode readers. The app was first created by external personnel who started off the project in a basic setup, I was then given that app and tasked with building it up from the ground. The app is connected to a WebAPI that I also had to program (in .Net Core 2.0) which is connected to through Restful requests which are tokenised to make sure they are secure in regards to the device they are using and the specific person that is logged in. All data that is downloaded to the device is stored in a singleton central environment which allows all data to be accessed anywhere around the app whilst also saving data (converted to JSON strings) to file for offline use. My knowledge of Android development was minimal when I started meaning that I had to do a lot of research into different solutions for the app whilst making sure that they would work well for the customers we had due to a lot of them not being advanced tech users meaning they need things to be simplified. The app features barcode scanning, location tracking and the ability to upload photographs as attachments to a Job whilst also allowing users to add manage their jobs and view lists of assets. The app was fully programmed by myself and the company aims to release it as a commercial product as soon as possible.
Starting with the Jobs section of the App I created a list view which would easily show a list of all Jobs that were assigned to that user, the user could then filter through that list via a search box searching through a few different fields (e.g. Job codes and descriptions) I eventually turned the list layout to run through a service that would also allow me to create other lists views a lot easier, therefore adding in ones for assets and audits. The Jobs view is the main section of the app, we went through a few iterations of design for this section using tabbed layouts and separate pages for each section before finally moving to use fragments and drawer layouts (similar to the Google Maps app where you can slide up from the bottom for more info). The main section of the jobs view was tweaked to give a configurable list of information on the Job moving all of the interactable sections into the bottom slide up parts on their own tabs (to separate them up to improve usability). The app is still in development with the main feature that we are currently working on being a tracking system that utilises the phones GPS to live track a user whilst also tracking their Journey which starts and stops with entering and leaving a Geofence respectively or through button actions in the Job view (if they have a button to say they are no longer travelling) This has been the most complex task that I have had to work with due to it being quite difficult to test, simply through not being able to go on test journeys and when we do we are often affected by external difficulties such as buildings blocking GPS signals or erroneous data. We programmed defensively for this and built an algorithm to improve a route once it is completed, this includes removing any duplicate points on a map and working out if any points are “out of place” and shouldn’t be there. We utilised a lot of Google API tools for the app including the Roads API to snap all the locations we have tracked for a route to a page and then building up a Web panel and using a Google Maps display to show the route to a manager.

<h4>Final Notes</h4>
<p>
    Overall I have learnt a lot through my year working at Rake Mark with my supervisor giving me a lot of freedom to work things out for myself and perform research in many different ways to learn. I feel I have improved through the year in how best to bring up points with my supervisor and the team in a way that is more articulated, having reasoning behind me plans and the confidence to be able to make them happen. The Android application which has been the biggest project I have worked on was a chance for me to learn a completely new field that although I had some previous linked knowledge it had not had the chance to do before. Developing the app allowed me to have freedom in my designs and structure my planning in a way that made aspects of the app work for everyone, I was the sole programmer on the app for the majority of the time and this allowed me to learn the process of taking a specification from my supervisors or a customers feature requests and trying to make them happen.
