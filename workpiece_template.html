<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>This game was created in Unity using C#. The theme of this Game Jam was "Change". Working in a team of 5 we set out to draw up some ideas, bouncing these ideas around we soon agreed on using change from a monetary perspective.
</p>
<h4>Submission Notes</h4>
<p>
We chose to take the theme of change in a different direction. Our idea is that you have a pocket full
of different coins, in other words “change” and you then must use that as your ammunition to
survive an endless wave of zombies. This tied in to having an educational aspect to it where you
must shoot the correct amount of coins at the zombies to kill them.

<h4>The Aim</h4>
<p>
Playing as a stationary character, the aim of the game is to hand out the correct change to the incomming zombies. If a zombie reaches you, you lose a life. The aim is to kill the zombies by handing the correct change to them, to switch between coins simply use the 1-7 keys. The least amount of coins given in an exchange, the more points are earnt, the player cannot give more change than they have.

<h4>My Tasks</h4>
<p>
My tasks for the Game Jam was to manage the games shared data, game over, handling of scores and the in-game UI.  
The games shared data needed to be available to each user, due to time constraints and for simplicity I decided to use a Singleton pattern to handle all scoring and lives the player might have, being able to always access the same "Player" object was important.
The game system handled lives, as previously mentioned these lives are gained and lost throughout the game and required easy updating, the UI would also need to show the correct number of hearts that the player had.
An extra feature I worked on required the use of C# Timers, part of the scoring mechanic was how long the player could last, utilising the C# timer we were able to cleanly update the UI with second based time steps.
I was able to improve my knowledge mainly on Unity's UI systems due to the amount of items we needed to display
