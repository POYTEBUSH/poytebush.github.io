<h4>Submission Notes</h4>
<p> We chose to take the theme of change in a different direction. Our idea is that you have a pocket full of different
    coins, in other words “change” and you then must use that as your ammunition to survive an endless wave of zombies.
    This tied in to having an educational aspect to it where you must shoot the correct amount of coins at the zombies
    to kill them. </p>
<h4>The Aim</h4>
<p> Playing as a stationary character, the aim of the game is to hand out the correct change to the incomming zombies.
    If a zombie reaches you, you lose a life. The aim is to kill the zombies by handing the correct change to them, to
    switch between coins simply use the 1-7 keys. The least amount of coins given in an exchange, the more points are
    earnt, the player cannot give more change than they have. </p>
<h4>My Tasks</h4>
<p> My tasks for the Game Jam was to manage the games shared data, game over, handling of scores and the in-game UI.
    The games shared data needed to be available to each user, due to time constraints and for simplicity I decided to
    use a Singleton pattern to handle all scoring and lives the player might have, being able to always access the same
    \"Player\" object was important. The game system handled lives, as previously mentioned these lives are gained and
    lost throughout the game and required easy updating, the UI would also need to show the correct number of hearts
    that the player had. An extra feature I worked on required the use of C# Timers, part of the scoring mechanic was
    how long the player could last, utilising the C# timer we were able to cleanly update the UI with second based time
    steps. I was able to improve my knowledge mainly on Unity's UI systems due to the amount of items we needed to
    display </p>
