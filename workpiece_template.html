<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Starting with a basic framework which contained a \"Dumb\" tank that had simple code to move to a point. The challenge of this module was to add pathfinding (A*) and decision making to help my tank win a battle against others.
 I was able to create a leading tank which is shown in the video below (purple tank). <i>Note that the other tanks were unavailable to show</i>
