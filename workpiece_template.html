<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Catalyst engine is coded in C++ using the SDL2 Graphics API. The engine is 2D and is aimed at RTS games and utilises a tile based map system.
    This project is currently on-going and involves the creation of the engine, followed by a game made with it.
    My role in the development involved being the team leader, organising meetings and managing the work-load of each team member.
    This module will also later require submission of design documentation on each section of the code.

<h4>My Involvement</h4>
<p>
    My current involvement in the engine started with the base SDL2 render-loop and the map. The map is loaded in from an XML (Tiny-XML), each map tile is store with it's relevant information and it's texture is pooled to ensure reduced memory useage.
    The map features A* pathfinding which is improved from a previous project to be more optimised and work with the map layout. Each map tile has a state to determine whether it's impassable and interactable, defining the pathfinding and interactions the map supplies.

    Later into the development the team noticed that inheritance and polymorphism were starting to create classes that had unnecessary. To combat this issue the team agreed on replicating a similar approach that is used by Unity, an Entity, Component based System. 
    By following a tutorial &nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsvI8Sng6dk'>Link</a>&nbsp;, I was able to learn the use of a bitmap to ensure that an entity can only have one of any type of component. 
    The creation of this ECS allowed us to easilly create different types of objects dynamically, the plan is to load in each type of entity from XML and pool those entities when required.
