<h4>My Involvement</h4>
<p>
My main involment in this project was taking the role of Team Manager, I was in charge of the tasks that each member took part of, the Github and its commits and helped to organise group meetings.
</p>
<p> with my project managment role I also helped to work on the overall games development, from discussing different ideas with the team and working out solutions for each.
I also was set the main graphics design role, creating or finding copy-right free images that we could use in the game.

<h4>Pitching to Playground Games</h4>
<p>
As previously mentioned, the team was given the oportunity to go to Playground Games' Headquatres and pitch the game and its design to a few developers. The aim of the pitch was to act like it was 
for a new release that we aimed to recieve funding for. The pitch required each team member to present their sections of the game to the audience, showing ideas for how they would improve their section and the future plans for the game.

<p>Overall our game was voted to be the most complete game and we impressed in our presentation.</p>
